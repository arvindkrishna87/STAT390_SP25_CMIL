Key questions for doctors
    1) Based on the images in slide 4 of "Managing Different Image Sizes.pptx" (in ML/David), which images do you think are too small to provide any useful information?
    2) We are planning to filter out some of the very small patches. How much of the image is it appropriate to leave unclassified (without a label)?
